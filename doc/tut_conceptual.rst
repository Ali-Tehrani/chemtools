Conceptual Density Functional Theory
####################################

This tutorial explains how to use ChemTools for computing reactivity descriptors defined within the
framework of conceptual DFT. To refresh your mind on theoretical background, please refer to
:ref:`Scientific Documentaion on Conceptual Density Functional Theory <conceptual_dft>`.

For an extensive set of examples demonstrating how to compute various global, local, condensed, and
non-local reactivity descriptors with ChemTools, please refer to
:ref:`Examples on Conceptual Density Functional Theory <examples_conceptual_dft>`.

In this tutorial, `formaldehyde <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formaldehyde>`_ is considered as an example.
If you are interested in following this tutorial step-by-step, make sure that the example files are download.
To do so, please refer to :ref:`Download Example Files <usr_lfs_files>`.
