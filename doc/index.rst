ChemTools |version|
###################

ChemTools is free and open source Python package for interpreting the results of
molecular quantum chemistry calculations, emphasizing conceptual tools associated
with, or at least inspired by, density-functional theory (DFT) and density-matrix theory.
ChemTools provides easy-to-use core functionality for the fundamental descriptors
from conceptual DFT, quantum chemical topology, etc., together with a flexible set
of utilities that scientists can use to easily test and contribute their own discoveries.
ChemTools is designed as a module of the HORTON package, but can post-process
calculations from any standard quantum chemistry program output.
